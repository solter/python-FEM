The setup files are organized as follows:

*prob<1,2>_<#>_<1,2,3>.setup
The first number indicates which problem this applies to
The second number indicates the mesh size used
The 3rd number represents the polynomial space used (note that the 2-d problems
did not use cubics in the interest of time)

Necesary files are the following:
../*prob<1,2>SupFunc.py
The supplementary functions (in this case the right hand side)
for the problem number

../meshes/<#>deq<#>.<node,ele>
The meshes. The first number is 1 or 2, the second number
is the number of elements along the bottom-ish
